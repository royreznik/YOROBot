Commands to be used: 

/Hello - generic hello message.

/movies - Sends movies that are playing in Cinema-City Glilot (scrape from seret.co.il, not working with the PythonAnywhere server due to inability to use urllib2 (not secure))

/gifs (won't work properly in mobile devices until getGifSize() will be implemented, works good on desktop.)
